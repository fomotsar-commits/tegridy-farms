/**
 * Wallet marks shared by the EVM and Solana connect modals.
 *
 * This module holds STRINGS ONLY and imports nothing — that is the whole
 * point. `rainbowkitWallets.ts` pulls in wagmi and RainbowKit at module
 * scope, so the Solana chunk must never import it; and duplicating a data URI
 * in two files is how the two modals end up showing different Trust marks a
 * year from now. A dependency-free constants module costs the Solana bundle
 * nothing and keeps one wallet looking like one wallet.
